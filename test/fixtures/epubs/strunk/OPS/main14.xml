<h3 class="section_title">6. Avoid a succession of loose
sentences.</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>This rule refers especially to loose sentences of a particular
type, those consisting of two co-ordinate clauses, the second
introduced by a conjunction or relative. Although single sentences
of this type may be unexceptionable (see under Rule 4), a series
soon becomes monotonous and tedious.</p>
<p>An unskilful writer will sometimes construct a whole paragraph
of sentences of this kind, using as connectives and, but, and less
frequently, who, which, when, where, and while, these last in
non-restrictive senses (see under Rule 3).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The third concert of the subscription series was given last
evening, and a large audience was in attendance. Mr. Edward
Appleton was the soloist, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra
furnished the instrumental music. The former showed himself to be
an artist of the first rank, while the latter proved itself fully
deserving of its high reputation. The interest aroused by the
series has been very gratifying to the Committee, and it is planned
to give a similar series annually hereafter. The fourth concert
will be given on Tuesday, May 10, when an equally attractive
programme will be presented.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from its triteness and emptiness, the paragraph above is
bad because of the structure of its sentences, with their
mechanical symmetry and sing-song. Contrast with them the sentences
in the paragraphs quoted under Rule 10, or in any piece of good
English prose, as the preface (Before the Curtain)
to&#160;<em>Vanity Fair</em>.</p>
<p>If the writer finds that he has written a series of sentences of
the type described, he should recast enough of them to remove the
monotony, replacing them by simple sentences, by sentences of two
clauses joined by a semicolon, by periodic sentences of two
clauses, by sentences, loose or periodic, of three
clauses—whichever best represent the real relations of the
thought.</p>
