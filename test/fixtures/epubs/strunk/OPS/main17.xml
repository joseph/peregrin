<h3 class="section_title">9. In summaries, keep to one tense.</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>In summarizing the action of a drama, the writer should always
use the present tense. In summarizing a poem, story, or novel, he
should preferably use the present, though he may use the past if he
prefers. If the summary is in the present tense, antecedent action
should be expressed by the perfect; if in the past, by the past
perfect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An unforeseen chance prevents Friar John from delivering Friar
Lawrence's letter to Romeo. Juliet, meanwhile, owing to her
father's arbitrary change of the day set for her wedding, has been
compelled to drink the potion on Tuesday night, with the result
that Balthasar informs Romeo of her supposed death before Friar
Lawrence learns of the nondelivery of the letter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But whichever tense be used in the summary, a past tense in
indirect discourse or in indirect question remains unchanged.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Legate inquires who struck the blow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the exceptions noted, whichever tense the writer
chooses, he should use throughout. Shifting from one tense to the
other gives the appearance of uncertainty and irresolution (compare
Rule 15).</p>
<p>In presenting the statements or the thought of some one else, as
in summarizing an essay or reporting a speech, the writer should
avoid intercalating such expressions as "he said," "he stated,"
"the speaker added," "the speaker then went on to say," "the author
also thinks," or the like. He should indicate clearly at the
outset, once for all, that what follows is summary, and then waste
no words in repeating the notification.</p>
<p>In notebooks, in newspapers, in handbooks of literature,
summaries of one kind or another may be indispensable, and for
children in primary schools it is a useful exercise to retell a
story in their own words. But in the criticism or interpretation of
literature the writer should be careful to avoid dropping into
summary. He may find it necessary to devote one or two sentences to
indicating the subject, or the opening situation, of the work he is
discussing; he may cite numerous details to illustrate its
qualities. But he should aim to write an orderly discussion
supported by evidence, not a summary with occasional comment.
Similarly, if the scope of his discussion includes a number of
works, he will as a rule do better not to take them up singly in
chronological order, but to aim from the beginning at establishing
general conclusions.</p>
